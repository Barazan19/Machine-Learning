# 🧠 Ridge and Lasso Regularization Explained

This project covers the entire journey of applying regularization to linear regression.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Linear regression overfitting
- L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) theory
- The role of alpha (λ)
- Coordinate descent & z_j explanation
- Soft-thresholding in Lasso
- Using RidgeCV and LassoCV to find optimal alpha

## 🧪 Dataset

We use the [insurance.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone repo
2. Add `insurance.csv` to root folder
3. Open and run all cells in `Regularization_Complete.ipynb`

## ✍️ Author

This notebook was generated to help beginners understand the intuition behind regularization, and demonstrate how it's implemented in Python.
